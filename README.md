Name your goat
==============

This is a **personal project**, currently not usable for other.

It is coded in strict vanilla languages: php 7.4, es6, html5 and css3.
The server-side php code follows a *simple MVC architecture*.
It was very interesting to code this one from scratch, without any framework.

Purpose of the project
----------------------

It provides a light website presenting our little farm and our goats herd.
The goats are presented in a "trombinoscope" way, a kind of Facegoat :-)
The website allows our friends/families to sponsor a goat, giving her a name.


Main characteristics
--------------------

- Mainly written in **vanilla php 7.4** (without framework neither library)
- MVC architecture
- Templates easy to read, written in html/php using the "short echo" syntaxt **\<?= ?>**
- Responsive design
- Powered in 2 languages (french and english) with an easy system to have more translations
- The little **data** are stored **as php arrays** (easy to write and read by humans, easy to access and use by php).
